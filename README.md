# Binary Clssification using scikit-learn library

## Importing Various Modules.
* Pandas and matplotlib modules downloaded

## Splitted training set into train set and validation set
* Numpy downloaded and for splitting used train_test_split from scikit-learn library.

## Modelling
* imported logistic regression from scikit-learn library 
* Applied logistic regression algorithm on train set to create model

## Compiling,summery and Fitting the model to the training set
* we fit our model using train set.

## Evaluating the Model Performance and Prediction
* Checked model performance on validation set and test set
* Calculated model score for both validation and test set.
